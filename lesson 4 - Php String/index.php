  /* 
    PHP Strings
    --------------*

    Strings in PHP are surrounded by either double quotation marks, or single quotation marks.

    Double or Single Quotes?

    You can use double or single quotes, but you should be aware of the differences between the two.
    Double quoted strings perform action on special characters.
